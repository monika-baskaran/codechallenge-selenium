# Code Challenge: Selenium Tests

__Selenium Skills Assessment__

Repo Location: https://github.com/tim-lynn-clark/codechallenge-selenium

## Summary

This Selenium code challenge provides each candidate a `consistent` and `fair` opportunity to demonstrate the skills they have developed and practiced over their years of software engineering.

Additionally, the challenge allows each candidate the ability to go `above and beyond` to make sure the development manager and team can see their `unique combination` of `skills and abilities` and better understand why they should be the newest member of our amazing team.

The challenge is designed to test the `QA skills`, `processes & procedures`, `git workflow`, `methods`, and `problem solving` used on a daily basis during quality assurance. It is anticipated that the majority of candidates will `NOT` complete the entirety of this code challenge. 

The extent of the requirements are simply there to provide candidates with options to move forward in the challenge if they become stuck on any one requirement. This also allows the same test to be used to assess developers with skill levels from entry to senior to architect.

Simply do your best to complete as many of the requirements as possible within the time allotted. Please document in your solution when you get stuck, your thoughts as to why you became stuck, and what you tried to become unstuck before moving on to another requirement. This documentation can go a long way in helping the team understand why you did not complete a requirement, where we can help you develop as a professional, and your problem-solving methodology. Don't let this challenge stress you out, we simply want to see what you can do and just as important how you do it!
